# Factorial
This Python script calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. The factorial function takes an integer n as an argument and returns the factorial of n. The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, in which case the factorial is 1. For other values of n, the factorial is calculated recursively by multiplying n with the factorial of n - 1.
